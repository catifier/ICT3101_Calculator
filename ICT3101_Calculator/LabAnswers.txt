Lab 2.3

19. Given the requirements above. Devise an Epic description to represent this set of requirements.

Allow the calculation of quality metrics.



20. Define some User Story examples for the Features.

As an Engineer,
I want to calculate the defect density of a system
So that I can perform quality metric calculations

As an Engineer,
I want to perform custom calculation for the new total number of Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) in the successive releases of a system
So that I can perform quality metric calculations

As an Engineer,
I want to use the Musa Logarithmic model for calculations
So that I can get the failure intensity and the number of expected failures



23. In using the BDD process to develop the new functions (and corresponding functionality)
what were some of the issues you faced? How did you resolve them to get things running?
