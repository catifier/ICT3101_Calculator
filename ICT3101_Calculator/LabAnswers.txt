Lab 2.3

19. Given the requirements above. Devise an Epic description to represent this set of requirements.

Allow the calculation of quality metrics.



20. Define some User Story examples for the Features.

US1:
As an Engineer,
I want to calculate the defect density of a system
So that I can perform quality metric calculations

US2:
As an Engineer,
I want to perform custom calculation for the new total number of Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) in the successive releases of a system
So that I can perform quality metric calculations

US3:
As an Engineer,
I want to use the Musa Logarithmic model for calculations
So that I can perform quality metric calculations



23. In using the BDD process to develop the new functions (and corresponding functionality)
what were some of the issues you faced? How did you resolve them to get things running?

Spent a lot of time thinking about good and effective behavior specifications (specifically gherkin scenarios).
